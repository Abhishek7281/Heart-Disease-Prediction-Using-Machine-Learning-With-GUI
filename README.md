# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-With-GUI
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of predicting heart disease using various machine learning algorithms. The project involves data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation to create a predictive model based on a heart disease dataset.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence of heart disease in patients. The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease Dataset, which contains various features related to patients' health metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of several attributes related to heart disease. The key features include:

age: Age of the patient

sex: Gender of the patient
cp: Chest pain type
trestbps: Resting blood pressure
chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
brestecg: Resting electrocardiographic results
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
exang: Exercise-induced angina
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
thal: Thalassemia
target: Target variable indicating the presence of heart disease
